- 👋 Hi, I’m Ajay Arora; I'm a 20-something year old software developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming in languages such as Java, Python, VB, C#. I'm also familiar with SQL databases and Linux based systems. My preferred IDEs are eclipse for object-oriented programming, and Visual Studio for web development work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- 🌱 I currently have a 2-year diploma in Computing Science from Thompson Rivers University in Canada, and I am working towards my diploma in IT & Management, as well as my Bachelor's degree in Computing Science. I am doing this via online classes, such that it will not interfere with any working schedules.

- 💞️ I’m currently looking for an internship to get my foot in the door in the IT/Computer Science industry, or for junior developer roles to further my experience. I have 3 years of post-secondary development experience, as well as some freelance web development work under my belt.

- 📫 Please feel free to contact me at arora.ajay90@gmail.com. If you do this, please indicate that you were referred from my Github profile.

Kind regards,

- Ajay Arora
