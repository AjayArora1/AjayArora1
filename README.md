Hi, I’m Ajay Arora; I'm a software developer.

I’m interested in computer programming in languages such as Java, Python, VB, C#. I'm also familiar with SQL databases and Linux based systems. My preferred IDEs are eclipse for object-oriented programming, and Visual Studio for web development work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I currently have a 4-year degree in Computing Science from Thompson Rivers University.

Please feel free to contact me at arora.ajay90@gmail.com. If you do this, please indicate that you were referred from my Github profile.

Kind regards,

- Ajay Arora
